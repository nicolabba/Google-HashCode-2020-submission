# Google-HashCode-2020-submission
Attempt at the Google Hash Code 2020 Qualification Round with my colleague [Samuele](https://github.com/szanella).

This repository contains both the original version of the code and an improved version of the code.

The original version scored 15,532,608 points in the Qualification Round, ranking us 5,326th among 10,724 teams.

The improved version scored more than 26.000.000 points during the extended round, just slightly more than a million points from the winner of the Qualification Round.
